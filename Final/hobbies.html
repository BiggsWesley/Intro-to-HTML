            <p>I have been drawing since I was a wee lad, even having one of my artworks framed in the Chattanooga
                courthouse back when I was in Elementary school. I drew here and there throughout school, but it wasn't
                until the Covid lockdown that I got serious about drawing. I used the large amounts of downtime to teach
                myself the fundamentals of art, and working towards improving my art. </p>

            <p>I originally got into 3D printing so that I could create mini models for my Dungeons and Dragons games. I
                went into it with no experience and had to teach myself how to effectively 3D print, including the file
                and support management. A few years later, I got into the tabletop wargame Warhammer 40k, which helped
                fuel my passion for 3D printing and model creation. Now I have years of experience 3D printing, model
                creation, and model painting. It has been a great learning experience and has let me save thousands of
                dollars in hobby purchases alone. Here is my Warhammer Army that I printed, built, and painted myself.

            <p>Ever since late high-school, I have been infatuated with board games, role-playing games, and tabletop
                wargames. It began when I gathered a bunch of my friends to DM our first DND campaign. We did not have
                miniatures, only pen, paper, and our imaginations. My fascination with board games continued to grow from
                there. The last couple years I have been deeply into the Sci-fi setting of Warhammer 40k. I began to
                play the actual game at the start of 10th edition and so far have been having a blast. The pictures show
                a few of my games in progress.

            <p>Like many men these days, I enjoy playing video games and is one of the major influences for pursuing a
                career in Computer Science and Digital Media. My favorite games are Intense Action games and Emotional
                Story-driven games. A few of my favorite games of all time are Halo:Reach, SMITE, Final Fantasy XIV, and
                Total War: Warhammer.</p>

            <h3>Reading</h3>

            <img src="images/blame2.jpg" alt="blame">
            <p>I have always been an avid reader. I read the entire Harry Potter series while I was still in elementary
                school, as well as others such as a Series of Unfortunate Events and the Percy Jackson series. My
                favorite genres have to be science fiction, fantasy, and horror. I also have a deep love for Japanese
                Manga and Korean Manwha. I believe my exposure to foreign comics sparked my interest in art and the
                desire to draw. My favorite Manga is BLAME! by Tsutomu Nihei, while my favorite book series is the
                Chronicles of Malus Darkblade.</p>
