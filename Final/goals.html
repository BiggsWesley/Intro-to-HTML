            <h3>Immediate</h3>
            <p>Graduate from Chattanooga State Community College, Transfer to East Tennessee State Univeristy.</p>

            <h3>Short Term</h3>
            <p>My current short term goal is to maintain a high GPA at Chattanooga State, then use Scholarships and the
                GI Bill to pay my way through college at ETSU. My major is in Computer Science with a minor in Digital
                Media. I plan to network and aquire the skills necessary to work on a creative team producing
                entertainment products such as movies or videogames.</p>
            <img src="images/etsu1.png" alt="etsu">
            <h3>Long Term</h3>
            <p>My long term goal is to aquire a stable career where I can be creative and hopefully independent. I plan
                on working for an entertainment company for awhile, and then work on my own projects. I hope to be
                financially stable to afford my own house and raise a family as well. I have already been working on an
                investment account, so hopefully I will be able to retire around 65 years old.</p>
