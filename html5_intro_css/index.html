            <p> The Kabal of the Darklight Kites are the masters of the sky. Striking realspace from the ancient and
                decadant
                Drukhari
                city of Commorragh, utilizing aerial supremecy to raid the many worlds of a galaxy.
                Led by
                the Self-Proclaimed "Scourge King", Archon Celeanos rules with a taloned grip. His obsession with
                collecting
                all
                manner of unique treasures and specimines is well known, much like a bird collecting treasures for his
                nest. The
                Selene Spire is a mega voidship port that many other Kabals and Cults use to launch raid, making the
                Darklight
                Kites one of the most wealthy and elite Kabals in Commorragh.</p>

            <h2>Who are the Drukhari?</h2>
            <p>The Eldar race are long lived, lithe, and have pointed ears. They are an acient race that
                once
                ruled the galaxy for millenia until their empire fell to depravity. She Who Thirsts, the Chaos God
                Slannesh, was born as a result of their empire wide debauchery. Her birth scream tore a hole open in
                realspace, instantly killing the majority of the Aeldari empire and splitting the survivors into two
                major Factions, the Asuryani and the
                Drukhari.
                The Drukhari are the evil and sadistic survivors of the old empire. Ever since the birth of Slannesh,
                every Drukhari's soul has begun to slowly whither away. In order to survive, the Drukhari must feed on
                other souls least they become whithered husks. They are Dark Elf
                Vampires in Space.
