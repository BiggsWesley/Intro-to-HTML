        <h2>Notable Kabalites</h2>
        <h3>The Dreaded Scourge King</h3>
        <img src="images/Scorge lord Archon png.png" alt="Celeanos">

        <h3>Archon Celeanos</h3>
        <p>The Self-proclaimed Scourge King, and rightfully so. Very few Archons would risk going through the painful
            and dangerous surgery to become one of the Scourge, but Archon Celeanos is no coward and embraces his new
            form with pride despite the sacrifices. Ruling the Kabal with a taloned grip, he sits atop the
            Selene tower watching the massive voidships dock, load, unload, and depart. Each client
            must pay a tax of only the most exotic specimines and treasures across the galaxy. Archon Celeanos rarely
            leaves his perch as of late, content to mule over his treasures, but will stretch his blackend
            wings to hunt on the most important and intresting realspace raids.</p>

                <h3>Prince Zamir</h3>
                <img src="images/Zamir head png.png" alt="Zamir">
                <p>The most recent Heir to Archon Celeanos, Prince Zamir is as arrogant as he is handsome (by Drukhari
                standards). As a trueborn, he belongs to the higher classes of Drukhari society, gaining access to the
                best training, armor, weapons, entertainment, everything. Transformed into a Scourge by the command of
                his father, the Prince has adopted the technique of "Dive-Bombing" his opponents to death, akin
                to a Falcon.</p>

                <h3>Dracon Zirik</h3>
                <img src="images/Zirik Head png.png" alt="Zirik">
                <p>The Dracon is the step directly below the Archon in the Heirarchy of a Kabal. Drachon Zirik's past is
                shrouded in mystery before joining the Kabal, but since joining, Zirik has schemed his way to the top
                using his unfathomable intellect and foresight. His duties as Drachon see him managing the vast wealth
                of the Kabal, docking schedules, planning realspace raids, and diplomatic negotiations.</p>

                <h3>Leilel</h3>
                <img src="images/Leilel Head png.png" alt="Leilel">
                <p>One of the newest members of the Kabal, Leilel serves as one of the few elite Kabalite warriors that have
                the honor of a permanent position in the Kabal. Before joining the Kabal, Leilel was apart of one of the
                Hellion gangs in lower Commorragh. After being abandoned during a realspace raid, she fought her way
                back into the Webway, and was accepted into the Kabal permanently by Prince Zamir. Leilel's ultimate
                goal however, is severing the head of Drachon Zirik.</p>
