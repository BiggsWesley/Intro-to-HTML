        <h2>A Brief History of the Kabal</h2>
        <p>The Kabal's history begins like all great Kabals in Commoragh, with an ambitious Drukhari and a mountain
            of corpses. Archon Celeanos was a lowly half-born Drukhari whose origins were that of a
            slave. During a major Dsyjunction, Archon Celeanos broke free of his chains and led an uprising against
            his Kabalite overlords. After the dust settled in Commorragh, Celeanos found himself the Archon the new
            Kabal of the Darklight Kites. His first act as Archon, was using his newly found wealth to transform
            himself and his closest followers into dreaded Scourge, a mix between Drukhari and Avians. Over the next
            thousand years, Archon Celeanos schemed, backstabbed, and built the Kabal to what it is today.</p>

        <h2>Realspace Raids</h2>
        <p>A realspace raid begins with extensive planning and scouting of a prime world. The Kabal will recruit large
            amounts of hired muscle from the nearby gangs, cults, and covens in order to bolster their ranks. When the
            Kabal is ready, the Drukahri will depart aboard the flagship "ShadowStrike" and traverse the webway until
            reaching a suitable portal to enter realspace. It is prefered to enter realspace directly above their prime
            target, using the voidships heavy weapons to rain down death on any defenses. After suitable bombardment,
            the Voidship releases it's deadly cargo into the city beginning with Razorwing Jetfighters and Voidraven
            Bombers. Following closly behind, the Scourges decend on black and violet wings carrying heavy weapons. The
            Hellion and Reaver gangs are next, riding eye watering skyboards and jetbikes to run down any forms of
            resistance. Finally, Raiders and Venoms transport all manner of Drukahri to the planet to sweep up survivors
            and reinforce any parts of the battlefield. The result is a series of lightning strikes against a suprised
            defender, wave after wave of devestation renering any meanigful resistance moot. If executed perfectly, the
            Kabal is free to plunder wealth and slaves from the world as they wish before departing just as swiftly as
            they arrived.</p>
