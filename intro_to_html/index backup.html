    <p>The Kabal of the Darklight Kites are the masters of the sky. Striking realspace from the ancient and decadant
        Drukhari
        city of Commorragh, the Kabalites utilize aerial supremecy to raid the many worlds of a galaxy in strife. Led by
        the Self-Proclaimed "Scourge King", Archon Celaenos rules with a taloned grip. His obsession with collecting all
        many of unique treasures and specimines is known well, much like a bird bringing treasures to his nest. The
        Selene Spire is a mega voidship port that many other Kabals and Cults use to launch raid, making the Darklight
        Kites one of the richest and elite Kabals in Commorragh.</p>

    <h2>Who are the Drukhari?</h2>
    <p>The Eldar race are long lived, lithe, and have pointed ears compared to humans. They are an acient race that once
        ruled the galaxy for millenia until their empire began to decline. A great calamity appeared, destroying much of
        the galaxy spanning empire and splitting the survivors into two major Factions, the Asuryani and the Drukhari.
        The Drukhari are the evil and depraved cousins of the Asuryani. They reside in the vast and impossible city of
        Commorragh, located in an alternate dimesion. Ever since the great Cataclism, each Drukhari has had their soul
        slowly whither away. In order to survive, the Drukhari must feed on other beings souls. They are Dark Elf
        Vampires in Space.
