    <p>The Kabal of the Darklight Kites are the masters of the sky. Striking realspace from the ancient and decadant Drukhari
        city of Commorragh, the Kabalites utilize aerial supremecy to raid the many worlds of a galaxy in strife. Led by
        the Self-Proclaimed "Scourge King", Archon Celaenos rules with a taloned grip. His obsession with collecting all
        many of unique treasures and specimines is known well, much like a bird bringing treasures to his nest. The
        Selene Spire is a mega voidship port that many other Kabals and Cults use to launch raid, making the Darklight
        Kites one of the richest and elite Kabals in Commorragh.</p>
